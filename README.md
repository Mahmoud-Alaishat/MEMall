<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project title should be self-explanatory and try not to make it a mouthful. (Although exceptions exist- **awesome-readme-writing-guide-for-open-source-projects** - would have been a cool name)

Add a cover/banner image for your README. **Why?** Because it easily **grabs people's attention** and it **looks cool**(*duh!obviously!*).

Wait, I forgot something. You can use this README as a template from [this link](README-template.md).

The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.

I personally use [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/) for creating the banner images. All the basic stuff is **free**(*you won't need the pro version in most cases*).

*What are all those flashy thingies below the title?*

Looks nice doesn't it? Those are called badges and they do improve the readability by giving some quick insights right?

There are endless badges that you could use in your projects. And they do depend on the project. Some of the ones that I commonly use in every projects are given below. 



# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.
